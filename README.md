# EFFERT-Index
My development code for the creation of the EFFERT Index. 
The EFFERT Index is a combination of the Economic Freedom Index, Global Green Economy Index, and an original index
that I created for female economic parity. This project was born from a desire to build on the concept of "economic freedom".
As it stands in the Economic Freedom Index, economic freedom deals more with regulations and levels of repression that a 
government exercises over its economy. I felt as though this index had a foundation that could be extended to create a more 
complete picture of the complicated, interconnected economic environment of the global economy. I chose to focus on environmental
awareness/regulation and gender parity, as these are frequently discussed in connection with each other. In fact, I was able to uncover 
a .45 correlation between the Global Green Economy Index and my own Female Economic Parity Index, suggesting a strong link between
the ways in which a country approaches climate change and their corresponding level of gender parity. This index is the first step in 
the creation of a forward-thinking index containing social and environmental justice elements that serve deeply impactful roles
in the global economy. As this is a first iteration of the index, I understand that there may be several questions regarding its 
creation. Please email me with any suggestions or issues that you may see with it at fultoncannon@gmail.com. I hope that this index 
may shed some light on how environmental awareness and gender parity affect the economy, in addition to pushing for index creation
that takes such elements into account. All data from this project was taken from the following sources.
